# Azure Cloud Resume Challenge
[Cloud Resume Challenge ](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/the-challenge/azure/)

## Objective
I created this project to complete the cloud resume challenge which is designed to demonstrate my full-stack cloud skills by creating a resume site hosted on Azure. Key elements of my solution include:
- Azure Static Web App: Hosts my resume as a static website.
- Serverless Backend: Azure Functions handle backend logic, such as a visitor count.
- Database Integration: Visitor counts and other data stored/retrieved from Azure Storage or Cosmos DB.
- CI/CD Pipeline: Automated builds and deployments via GitHub Actions

### Skills Learned

- Cloud Architecture: Designing and deploying a fully-functional, serverless application on Azure.
- Azure Services: Setting up and configuring key services like Azure Static Web Apps, Functions, Cosmos DB, Azure DNS, Azure Storage, Azure CDN
- CI/CD Pipeline: Implementing automated testing, builds, and deployments through GitHub Actions.
- Full-Stack Development: Creating a modern, responsive frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) backed by serverless APIs.
- Security & Access Control: Managing roles, permissions, and secure deployments in Azure.
- Continuous Learning: Strengthening problem-solving and debugging skills through hands-on cloud project work.

### Tools Used

- Azure Portal
- Visual Studio
- Programming: Python, HTML, CSS, JS, YML

### Prerequisites 

- Azure Subscription
- Code Editor
- Registered Domain

## Steps
### Step 1 - Create Static Website using HTML & CSS

### Step 2 - Use Azure Storage account to deploy your website as a [Azure Storage static website](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website)

### Step 3 - Configure [Azure CDN](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-custom-domain-name?tabs=azure-portal#map-a-custom-domain-with-https-enabled) to serve your static website and enable HTTPS for security.

### Step 4 - Point a custom DNS domain name to your Azure CDN endpoint

### Step 5 - Create Azure CosmosDB to store view count for your website

### Step 6 - Create API using Azure Function App to get and increment view count stored in CosmosDB

### Step 7 - Write some JavaScript to call Azure function and display view count on your website

### Step 8 - CI/CD for Front End

### Step 9 - CI/CD for Back End
